    " 1. Run a code cell\n",
    " 1. Use a variable\n",
    " 1. Call a Python function\n",
    " 1. Call a Python method\n",
    " 1. Access the help text for a function or method\n",

    "I'll walk you through these five things. I'll be oversimplifying things a little to shield you from some underlying complexity and just give you the absolute bare minimum knowledge required to tackle the exercise during the lecture. For a proper introduction to Python, I recommend reading \"[A Whirlwind Tour of Python](http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/files/a-whirlwind-tour-of-python.pdf)\"."
